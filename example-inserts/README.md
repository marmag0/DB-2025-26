# Example Inserts


### Purpose

This directory provides a **fast and easy** way to insert test data into tables to ensure that **all functionalities work correctly**. Since the project has not been implemented yet, it does not contain any real records and won't in the nearest future.


### Naming Convention

To ensure consistency and maintain order across the entire repository, the naming convention for `.sql` insert scripts will be:

```
desc_exampleInsert.sql
```

- `desc` - some information about `INSER` script purpose in camelCase  
- `exampleInsert.sql` - the fixed ending of the filename
